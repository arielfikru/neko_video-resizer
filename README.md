# neko_video-resizer

Hello! I made this because I often get frustrated when my video files are too big. üòÖ

## How to Use

1. First, download all the Python files
2. Make sure you have Python installed
3. Install the requirements:
   ```
   pip install huggingface_hub torch requests
   ```
4. Run the script like this:
   ```
   python main.py input_video.mp4 output_video.mp4 --target_size 1000
   ```
   1000 means you want to make it 1000 MB. You can change this as you like.

## Cool Features

- Can compress video to a size we want
- Can use files from your computer or from Hugging Face
- Can upload the results back to Hugging Face (if you want)

## Problems?

If there are any errors or if you're confused about how to use it, I apologize as I'm still learning. üòÖ But you can try it out, who knows it might work.

## Final Words
